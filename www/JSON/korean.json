Now, the alphabet is the official script of both South Korea and North Korea, and co-official in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture of China's Jilin Province. In both South and North Korea, Hangul is used solely to write Korean language as using Hanja (Chinese characters) in typical Korean writing had fallen out of common usage during the late 1990s."},
